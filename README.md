# eq-author-framer-prototypes
Repository for prototypes built with FramerX

## NOTE

Once downloaded, you will need to rename the folder from `eq-author-framer-prototypes` to `whatever-you-want.framerx`, adding the `.framerx` file extension so that Framer X will treat it as a project file. From there, you can still edit files within and interact with git, etc.

For more information, see [the documentation ](https://www.framer.com/support/using-framer-x/folder-backed-projects/) on "folder backed projects".
